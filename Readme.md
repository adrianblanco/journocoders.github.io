# journocoders.com

This are the source files for [Journocoders.com](http://journocoders.com), a simple website for archiving our past events.

## Adding past events

Edit the CSV files in the `_data` folder. When you push up to GitHub, it will automatically generate the HTML page.

## Changing the design and layout

This website uses the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) platform. [Installation instructions are here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Once you have installed everything, just run:

    jekyll serve --watch
    
and go to [localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) in your browser.
