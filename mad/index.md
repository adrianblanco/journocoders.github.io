We help journalists and other people working in the media develop technical skills for use in their reporting.

That might be data analysis as part of an investigation, scraping data from government websites, building data visualisations to better tell a story, or something else entirely.

We run a free meetup in Madrid where we try to learn these skills together. All sessions are appropriate for complete beginners and above.
